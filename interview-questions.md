# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: parameters are the template for what goes in the argument. The parameters are asking for a value and you supply the value in the argument. For example, the parameters could be color, size, and flavor. The arguments would be pink, small, and vanilla.

  Researched answer: Parameters are variables that act as placeholders inside the parentheses of the function. Arguments are the things that are passed into the function when it's invoked. We must have the same number of parameters as we do arguments as they correspond.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: arrays but I know there are 2 more I just cannot remember

  Researched answer: value, indexe, array. the index and array are optional whereas values are required.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map *does something* to each value in an array and returns an array of the same length. filter makes a *decision* about each value in the array and returns and array with the content that meets that filtered criteria.

  Researched answer: My answer was correct for both and I found that map has a return for the outer function as well as a return for higher-order functions. I also found that Filter returns a subset of arrays and, to put it another way, returns only the values that are truthy.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is the action of an object. A method is when a function belongs to an object.

  Researched answer: Functions: reusable blocks of code, live by themselves -is independent, has data passed inside, can be called by it's name, a set of instructions that peform a task, but not directly linked to an object. Methods: are functions linked to an object, uses dot notation to call a method on an object



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:The re-assignment of variables

  Researched answer: This is the re-assignment of variables so that we don't have to keep repeating ourselves. It keeps our code tighter and cleaner.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Not a clue. Maybe moving something from up one page to another? Did I miss this in class??

  Researched answer: A behavior in JS that moves variables, classes, and function declarations to the top of their scope before executing the code



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: When you make a new class (the child) that takes in the attributes of the original class (the parent).

2. React:Created from Facebook, React creates interactive webpages. It handles user interactions and reacts to changes made by the user without refreshing the page. It is component-based, meaning it allows us to build smaller parts and then join them together to form a whole app. It is used to build mobile apps and mobile webpages, and regular webpages. It relies on a virtual DOM.

3. React state: State gives us the ability to manage changing data in an application that is also interactive. It's an object where we define key-value pairs specifying various data we want to track in the application.

4. React lifecycle methods: In React every component has it's own lifecycle where you can monitor and manipulate during it's 3 phases. Those phases are mounting, updating, and unmounting.

5. DOM: Dom stands for Document object model and is an API (application programming interface) for HTML. It's the user interface of a webpage, the visual representation of HTML code.
